![React with Redux](2020-03-13-171827_1363x298_scrot.png)

This is a React application that I built to teach the basics of Redux in the Computer Science Club at IUPUI. This application uses a single data store. Data is extracted from the store using the `mapStateToProps()` function, and actions are dispatched using the `mapDispatchToProps()` function.

For my main component, I used a [react-awesome-button](https://caferati.me/demo/react-awesome-button). These are definitely worth checking out! After creating a functional app, I deployed it using using [ZEIT](https://zeit.co).

See the slides for the React with Redux presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HxZMOhExp5-jn0QsKB_-gDReVhMStyzjv9b6U6EbBFc/edit?usp=sharing)! Additionally, checkout the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) websites for more information and some great tutorials.
